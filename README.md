Hello and welcome to my website template builder.

There are two different ways to build a website using this.  You can use either a Bash script (build.sh) or a Python script (build.py).  Running either of these scripts will combine the top and bottom template file, found in the Template folder, with the files found in the content folder building a website.

You will also find additional bash and python scripts found in the port folder.  These will build a different website, using the same principle as above.
