<h2>About\Contact Me</h2>

<p>Hello, I am Chris, an aspiring full stack developer.  I've been tinkering with websites for 20 years now.  I did so professionally during the dotcom boom, but switched gears after that bubble popped.  I finally decided it was time to get back into it and I am attending a bootcamp and getting ready to code for a living,  I am pumped.  I graduated from San Diego State University with a degree in applied design with an emphasis in metal.  I've lived in the bay area for over 30 years, currently in Berkeley with my two cats, Lily and Callie. </p>
